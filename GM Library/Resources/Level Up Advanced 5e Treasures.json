It's probably easier just to wad it up and stick it in your pocket. The interior of this ball of web is an extradimensional space equivalent to a 10-foot cube. To place things into this space you must push it into the web, so it cannot hold liquids or gasses. You can only retrieve items you know are inside, making it excellent for smuggling. Retrieving items takes at least 2 actions (or more for larger objects) and things like loose coins tend to get lost inside. No matter how full, the web never weighs more than a half pound.\n\nA creature attempting to divine the contents of the web via magic must first succeed on a DC 28 Arcana check which can only be attempted once between long rests.\n\nAny creature placed into the extradimensional space is placed into stasis for up to a month, needing no food or water but still healing at a natural pace. Dead creatures in the web do not decay. If a living creature is not freed within a month, it is shunted from the web and appears beneath a large spider web 1d6 miles away in the real world."

Animal or vegetable matter placed completely inside is instead ingested and destroyed.\n\nWhen part of a creature is inside the bag (including a creature reaching a hand inside) there is a 50% chance the bag pulls it inside. A creature that ends its turn inside the bag is ingested and destroyed.\n\nA creature inside the bag can try to escape by using an action and making a DC 15 Strength check. Creatures outside the bag can use an action to attempt to reach in and pull a creature out with a DC 20 Strength check. Would-be rescuers are subject to the same 50% chance to be pulled inside.\n\nPiercing or tearing the item destroys it, with anything currently inside shifted to a random location on the Astral Plane. Turning the bag inside out closes the mouth."

If you have never interacted with a specific bag of holding before, the first time you use it, it requires 1d4 rounds to take stock of its contents before anything can be retrieved from the bag.\n\nFood or water placed in the bag immediately and permanently lose all nourishing qualities-after being in the bag, water no longer slakes thirst and food does not sate hunger or nourish. In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the bag cannot be restored to life by *revivify*, *raise dead*, or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.\n\nThe bag cannot hold any item that would not fit in a normal bag of its apparent size or any item with the Bulky quality.\n\nIf the bag is punctured, torn, or otherwise structurally damaged, it ruptures and is destroyed, and the contents are scattered throughout the Astral Plane.\n\nPlacing a bag of holding inside another extradimensional storage device such as a portable hole or handy haversack results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane.

You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects inside remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing. If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened."

You gain no benefits from a long or short rest while mounted in the war engine, and when you expend its last available charge you suffer both a level of fatigue and strife.\n\nWhile you are attuned to, mounted inside, and controlling the Serveros War Engine, you gain the following benefits:\n\n- Your AC becomes 18.\n- Your Strength score becomes 21.\n- You are Huge-sized.\n- Your Speed becomes 40 feet.\n- You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid being grappled or knocked prone.\n- You sustain only 1 hit point of damage for every 5 hit points of nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt to you.\n- Your unarmed strikes deal 4d8 bludgeoning damage.\n- Your weapon attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.\n- You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n- You are vulnerable to psychic damage.\n\n**Charged Properties**\nThe war engine has several built-in features, some of which are powered by stored electrical charges or life energy.\n- A sword hilt is secured to the construct's hip by an incredible magnetic force. As a bonus action you can either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to draw the hilt and engage its plasma blade. **Plasma Blade**. Melee Weapon Attack: reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8+5) radiant damage, or 21 (3d10+5) radiant damage if wielded in two hands.\n- An arcane cannon is housed in the construct's left forearm. You can use an action or bonus action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the arcane cannon. **Arcane Cannon**. Ranged Weapon Attack: range 120/300 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) radiant damage.\n- You can use an action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the construct's right gauntlet as a projectile. **Gauntlet Grapple**. Ranged Weapon Attack: range 60/120 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d8+5) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d6 +5) bludgeoning damage and if the target is a Large or smaller creature it is grappled. As a bonus action you can retract the hand up to 120 feet and reconnect it to the construct. A grappled target moves with the hand.\n\nThe Serveros War Engine begins with 1d20 charges. By making a DC 18 Intelligence (Engineering) check, 2d10 charges can be restored during a long rest."

Originally called the Sword of All Traditions, over time the gems in the pommel were lost and now only three remain. Should its lost gemstones be returned, the blade might be restored to its full spectrum of glory and power.\n\n**Legends and Lore**\nSuccess on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\nDC 15: This is the Sword of Three Traditions, which grants mastery of the techniques of combat. Each of the three gemstones in its hilt represents a tradition of combat.\nDC 18: The sword can transform into other weapons based on the gemstones in its hilt.\nDC 21: Only a dragon of the same color can destroy the sword's gemstones.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\nThe Sword of Three Traditions has two lesser artifact benefits, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. For each of the first five magical gemstones restored to the sword, it gains 1 lesser artifact benefit. For each of the last three magical gemstones restored to it, the sword gains 1 greater artifact detriment and 1 greater artifact benefit.\n\nThe Sword of Three Traditions is a **+1** longsword. Once you are attuned, you can use an action to turn the sword into a different **+1** weapon. In addition, when you use a combat maneuver, the sword automatically changes into the weapon associated with that tradition. To change into a given weapon, the gem associated with that tradition must be attached.\n\nWhile holding the sword, when you use a combat maneuver of a tradition associated with an attached gem, its exertion cost is reduced by 1 (minimum 1 exertion)."

      "description": "The Veil of Fate is a diaphanous silver and gray cloth attached to a thin silvery band which is worn on the bearer's head. When worn correctly, it falls to the floor around its bearer, covering them entirely in a faint silver shimmer. It is unknown whether or not this appearance is due purely to the physical nature of the veil or its powers taking the bearer slightly beyond the bounds of reality.\n\n**Legends and Lore**\nSuccess on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\nDC 15: This is the Veil of Fate, which allows the wearer to see the very strands of destiny.\nDC 18: The veil grants glimpses into the future.\nDC 21: Many who have donned the veil are immediately struck by disturbingly accurate premonitions of the future.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\nThe Veil of Fate has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment.\n\nWhen you are wearing and attuned to the veil, creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you as the combination of your enhanced foresight and diaphanous appearance bamboozles your foes.\n\nThe glimpses of the future granted by the Veil of Fate are not always advantageous. You are always last in the initiative order as you are overwhelmed with insights into the events that are about to unfold, though you may choose to use your foretelling roll (see Control Fate below) for all of your initiative checks for the day.\n\nIn addition, you can impart some of the veil's power by falling into a deep meditation for 8 hours. When your meditation is concluded, your touch bestows one of the benefits of the Veil of Fate onto an allied creature, and you suffer a level of fatigue from the effort.\n\n**Foretelling**\nAt the Narrator's discretion, when you first attune to the Veil of Fate you are granted a detailed premonition of future events, presenting the opportunity to intertwine those threads of fate with your own. You can perfectly recall the premonition for a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 day), after which the memory is gone as if you never experienced it. Anything you write down or otherwise record about the premonition during this time is all that remains. Another creature may be given a different premonition or no premonition upon attuning to the veil. You can occasionally recall key details of the premonition at important crossroads in the future before the depicted events occur, and otherwise receive guidance from the premonition long after you've forgotten it.\n\n**Choose Your Destiny**\nWhile attuned to the Veil of Fate you are keenly aware of your own destiny.\nWhen you spend 8 hours meditating on your destiny and life's purpose, you can see some of the steps you must take to change it. This meditation brings on a profound change, and when it is concluded you may choose a new Destiny.\n\n**Control Fate**\nWhen you finish a long rest, you are bolstered by a strange sense of how to get the most out of your interactions and endeavours, gaining inspiration.\n\nIn addition, after completing a long rest you roll a d20. This is your foretelling roll. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you may choose to replace the d20 roll with your foretelling roll. You may choose to use this property after seeing the initial roll, but before any of the roll's effects occur. Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until finishing a long rest.\n\n**Magic**\nYou may cast *augury* at will while attuned to and wearing the Veil of Fate.\nTwice per long rest you can cast one of the following spells without consuming material components or expending a spell slot: *arcane eye*, *clairvoyance*, *commune*, *divination*.\nRoll a d20 after each long rest. On an 18 or above, you gain the benefits of the *foresight* spell."

Any knowledgeable scholar knows there is good reason for the practice-sometimes when left idle for too long without a master the hut walks of its own accord directly towards the nearest planar portal, and all those known to have claimed ownership have disappeared under mysterious circumstances.\n\nA simple bed and table permanently affixed to the floor in this shuttered wooden hut, and it is able to fit up to 12 Medium or smaller creatures inside. After taking a long rest inside of the hut, you make a DC 21 Perception check, seeing through the veil and revealing its true nature on a success-strange markings and other signs of witchcraft cover nearly every surface of the interior and it reeks of chicken effluent. Once the veil is seen through, there are 8 glowing runes on the table, each only half-illuminated. When you pass your hand over a rune, the energies inside respond and you can fully illuminate it or remove its glow entirely. When certain runes are illuminated, enormous chicken legs beneath the hut rise it up off of the ground. The Chicken Hut is a Gargantuan object with an **Armor Class** of 21, a total of 320 hit points, **Speed** 50 ft. or swim 10 ft. (0 ft. if the legs aren't extended), and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.\n\nThe hut floats on water. While the hut's door and window shutters are closed, the interior is airtight and watertight. The interior holds enough air for 60 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nYou can use an action to control the illumination of as many as two of the hut's runes, and a bonus action to control a third. After each use, a rune goes back to its neutral position. Each rune, from left to right, functions as shown in the Walking Chicken Hut Runes table.\n\nIf you are not attuned to any magic items and spend a week inside of the Walking Chicken Hut, you can attune to it. The hut uses 2 of your attunement slots. Once attuned, as long as you can see it you can use your bonus action to manipulate as many as 3 of its runes.\n\n**Legends and Lore**\nSuccess on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\nDC 15: This is the Walking Chicken Hut, home to many wielders of magic throughout the ages.\nDC 18: The hut is known to move and act of its own accord.\nDC 21: The hut can be controlled using the runes on the table within.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\nThe Walking Chicken Hut has one lesser artifact detriment and one greater artifact detriment."

However, these potent artifacts are imbued with material from the netherworld and only five are known to have been created.\n\nConnected via the realm of the dead, with proper use a person can communicate simultaneously with any number of other Whispering Stones and message stones, or even stream thoughts from places and beings beyond death.\n\n**Legends and Lore**\nSuccess on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\nDC 15: This is a Whispering Stone, which allows communication across long distances. Only five of these stones were ever created.\nDC 18: The stones can speak to each other.\nDC 21: The stones can also speak to the dead, or ask questions of powerful extraplanar beings.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\nEach time you use a Whispering Stone to cast a spell, roll a d20. On a 1, the casting connects your mind with that of an extradimensional entity chosen by the Narrator. You begin to hear this entity's thoughts in your head (and vice versa), and if you were not already attuned to the Whispering Stone, you immediately attune to it. In Faddition, you gain one short-term mental stress effect that lasts for 1d6 days. The voice in your head remains for as long as the mental stress effect.\n\nIf you simultaneously connect to two or more extradimensional entities, you make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain a long-term mental stress effect.\n\n**Magic**\nWhile touching a Whispering Stone you can use an action to cast *sending*. The target is a creature that carries a message stone or Whispering Stone you have seen before. If no creature currently bears that stone, or if you have never seen a message stone or Whispering Stone before, your message is conveyed to another recipient. The Narrator may select a specific creature to receive the message or consult the Whispering Stones Listener table. This recipient of your message learns your name, current location, and that you bear a Whispering Stone.\n\nA Whispering Stone begins with 6 charges and regains 1d4+1 charges each dusk. While attuned to the stone, you can use an action to cast *speak with dead* (1 charge) and *spirit guardians* (1 charge). If also connected to an extra dimensional entity, you can cast *divination* (once between long rests) to ask the entity a question."
