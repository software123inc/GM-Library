Otherwise a construct's statistics are determined by its size.\n\nIf you animate 4 or more Small or Tiny objects, instead of controlling each construct individually they function as a construct swarm. Add together all of the objects hit points to determine the construct swarm's total hit points. Attacks against a construct swarm deal half damage. The construct swarm reverts to individual constructs when it is reduced to 15 hit points or less.\n\nYou can use a bonus action to mentally command any construct made with this spell while it is within 500 feet. When you command multiple constructs using this spell, you may simultaneously give them all the same command. You decide the action the construct takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. Without commands the construct only defends itself. The construct continues to follow a command until its task is complete. \n\nWhen you command a construct to attack, it makes a single slam melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit the construct deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage appropriate to its shape.\n\nWhen the construct drops to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal object form.\n\nCast at Higher Levels. \nYou can animate 2 additional Small or Tiny objects for each slot level above 5th.",

At the Narrator's discretion, sufficiently powerful artifacts and deities may be able to ignore the sphere's effects.\n\nArea Suppression: When a magical effect protrudes into the sphere, that part of the effect's area is suppressed. For example, the ice created by a wall of ice is suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. \n\nCreatures and Objects: While within the sphere, any creatures or objects created or conjured by magic temporarily wink out of existence, reappearing immediately once the space they occupied is no longer within the sphere. \n\nDispel Magic: The sphere is immune to dispel magic and similar magical effects, including other antimagic field spells. \n\nMagic Items: While within the sphere, magic items function as if they were mundane objects. Magic weapons and ammunition cease to be suppressed when they fully leave the sphere.\n\nMagical Travel: Whether the sphere includes a destination or departure point, any planar travel or teleportation within it automatically fails. Until the spell ends or the sphere moves, magical portals and extradimensional spaces (such as that created by a bag of holding) within the sphere are closed.\n\nSpells: Any spell cast within the sphere or at a target within the sphere is suppressed and the spell slot is consumed. Active spells and magical effects are also suppressed within the sphere. If a spell or magical effect has a duration, time spent suppressed counts against it.\n\nRare Versions\nLeska's Denying Antimagic Field.

While frightened the creature must use its movement to move away from the target to the nearest safe spot from which it can no longer see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can no longer see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it. \n\nSympathy: When a designated creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature uses its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target, and is unwilling to move away from the target.\n\nIf the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect.

Once the water moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its regular flow based on the terrain.\n\nWhirlpool: If the affected body of water is at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep, a whirlpool forms within the area in a 50-foot wide cone that is 25 feet long.

While it is temporarily dismissed, you can use an action to call it back, causing it to appear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\n\nYou can't have more than one familiar at a time, but if you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you can cause it to adopt a different form. \n\nFinally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch and your familiar is within 100 feet of you, it can deliver the spell as if it was the spellcaster.

On a failed save, choose from one of the forms of bindings below (each lasts until the spell ends).\n\nBurial: The target is buried deep below the surface of the earth in a tomb just large enough to contain it. Nothing can enter the tomb. No teleportation or planar travel can be used to enter, leave, or affect the tomb or its contents. A small mithril orb is required for this casting.\n\nChaining: Chains made of unbreakable material erupt from the ground and root the target in place. The target is restrained and cannot be moved by any means. A small adamantine chain is required for this casting.\n\nHedged Prison: The target is imprisoned in a maze-like demiplane of your choosing, such as a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, a hedge maze, or any similar structure you desire. The demiplane is warded against teleportation and planar travel. A small jade representation of the demiplane is required for this casting.\n\nMinimus Containment: The target shrinks to just under an inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone, crystal, jar, or similar object. Nothing but light can pass in and out of the vessel, and it cannot be broken, cut, or otherwise damaged. The special component for this effect is whatever prison you wish to use.\n\nSlumber: The target is plunged into an unbreakable slumber and cannot be awoken. Special soporific draughts are required for this casting.\n\nThe target does not need sustenance or air, nor does it age. No divination spells of any sort can be used to reveal the target's location.\n\nWhen cast, you must specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. This condition must be based on some observable action or quality and not related to mechanics like level, hitpoints, or class, and the Narrator must agree to it.\n\nA dispel magic only dispels an imprisonment if it is cast using a 9th-level spell slot and targets the prison or the special component used to create the prison.\n\nEach casting that uses the same spell effect requires its own special component. Repeated castings with the same component free the prior occupant. \n\nRare Versions\nKrevan's Insidious Imprisonment. This terrifying variant of the spell is only different when using Slumber. While asleep, the target is subjected to dreams or nightmares specified by you and created by the target's own subconscious. These nightmares seem more real than the target's own lives, which become dreamlike and false, allowing you to implant false narratives, experiences, or episodes in the target's mind, changing the target's nature and turning allies into enemies or heroes into villains. Only a wish or similarly powerful effect can restore the target's memories.",

If you have a specific servant in mind you may speak its name during the casting, but ultimately who is sent to answer your call is the entity's decision. \n\nThe creature that appears (typically a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend), is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way other than how its nature and personality directs it. Any request made of the creature, simple or complex, requires an equal amount of payment which you must bargain with the creature to ascertain. The creature can request either items, sacrifices, or services in exchange for its assistance. A creature that you cannot communicate with cannot be bargained with.\n\nA task that can be completed in minutes is worth 100 gold per minute, a task that requires hours is worth 1,000 gold per hour, and a task requiring days is worth 10,000 gold per day (the creature can only accept tasks contained within a 10 day timeframe). A creature can often be persuaded to lower or raise prices depending on how a task aligns with its personality and the goals of its masterósome require no payment at all if the task is deemed worthy. Additionally, a task that poses little or no risk only requires half the usual amount of payment, and an extremely dangerous task might call for double the usual payment. Still, only extreme circumstances will cause a creature summoned this way to accept tasks with a near certain result of death. \n\nA creature returns to its place of origin when a task is completed or if you fail to negotiate an agreeable task and payment. Should a creature join your party, it counts as a member of the group and receives a full portion of any experience gained.\n\nRare Versions\nLeska's Forbidden Planar Ally. The spell allows the summoning of an aberration. \n\nRoav's Cruel Planar Ally. The creature summoned by this spell is always a fiend linked to you. The bargaining costs for all requests made with the fiend are halved, but in exchange the fiend uses the link to gain advantage on saving throws and checks made to avoid being banished or bound, it has resistance to all damage, and each time the fiend takes damage you take an equal amount of damage. Damage inflicted by this spell cannot kill you. ",

You change into the average version of that creature, and do not gain any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.\n\nUntil the spell ends or you are dropped to 0 hit points, your game statistics (including your hit points) are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, though you keep your Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores. You also keep your skill and saving throw proficiencies as well as gaining the creature's. However, if you share a proficiency with the creature, and the creature's bonus is higher than yours, you use the creature's bonus. You keep all of your features, skills, and traits gained from your class, heritage, culture, background, or other sources, and can use them as long as the creature is physically capable of doing so. You do not keep any special senses, such as darkvision, unless the creature also has them. You can only speak if the creature is typically capable of speech. You cannot use legendary actions or lair actions. Your gear melds into the new form. Equipment that merges with your form has no effect until you leave the form.\n\nWhen you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If the spell's effect on you ends early from dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form and knocks you unconscious if the damage reduces you to 0 hit points.\n\nUntil the spell ends, you can use an action to change into another form of your choice. The new form follows all the rules as the previous form, with one exception: if the new form has more hit points than your previous form, your hit points remain at their previous value.\n\nRare Versions\nNevard's Malleable Form. When you cast this spell, you can choose to add an additional physical trait or change one existing trait of the form you adopt. For example, you can add wings or gills to a creature that does not normally have them (and gain flight or water breathing), change the color of fur or scales, add a poisonous barb to the end of a tail, and so on.",

You must know the location you're teleporting to, and it must be on the same plane of existence.\n\nTeleportation is difficult magic and you may arrive off-target or somewhere else entirely depending on how familiar you are with the location you're teleporting to. When you teleport, the Narrator rolls 1d100 and consults Table: Teleport Familiarity.\n\nFamiliarity is determined as follows:\n\nPermanent Circle: A permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know (see teleportation circle).\n\nAssociated Object: You have an object taken from the target location within the last 6 months, such as a piece of wood from the pew in a grand temple or a pinch of grave dust from a vampire's hidden redoubt.\n\nVery Familiar: A place you have frequented, carefully studied, or can see at the time you cast the spell.\n\nSeen Casually: A place you have seen more than once but don't know well. This could be a castle you've passed by but never visited, or the farms you look down on from your tower of ivory.\n\nViewed Once: A place you have seen once, either in person or via magic.\n\nDescription: A place you only know from someone else's description (whether spoken, written, or even marked on a map).\n\nFalse Destination: A place that doesn't actually exist. This typically happens when someone deceives you, either intentionally (like a wizard creating an illusion to hide their actual tower) or unintentionally (such as when the location you attempt to teleport to no longer exists).\n\nYour arrival is determined as follows:\n\nOn Target: You and your targets arrive exactly where you mean to.\n\nOff Target: You and your targets arrive some distance away from the target in a random direction. The further you travel, the further away you are likely to arrive. You arrive off target by a number of miles equal to 1d10 ◊ 1d10 percent of the total distance of your trip. If you tried to travel 1,000 miles and roll a 2 and 4 on the d10s, you land 6 percent off target and arrive 600 miles away from your intended destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 to randomly determine the direction: 1ónorth, 2ónortheast, 3óeast, 4ósoutheast, 5ósouth, 6ósouthwest, 7ówest, 8ónorthwest.\n\nSimilar Location: You and your targets arrive in a different location that somehow resembles the target area. If you tried to teleport to your favorite inn, you might end up at a different inn, or in a room with much of the same decor. Typically you appear at the closest similar location, but that is not always the case.\n\nMishap: The spell's magic goes awry, and each teleporting creature or object takes 3d10 force damage. The Narrator rerolls on the table to determine where you arrive. When multiple mishaps occur targets take damage each time.\n\nRange: Same Plane",

        "Desc": "You call a Gargantuan monstrosity from the depths of the world to carry you and your allies across great distances. When you cast this spell, the nearest purple worm within range is charmed by you and begins moving toward a point on the ground that you can see. If there are no purple worms within range, the spell fails. The earth rumbles slightly as it approaches and breaks through the surface. Any creatures within 20 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 10 feet away from it.\n\nUpon emerging, the purple worm lays down before you and opens its maw. Targets can climb inside where they are enclosed in an impervious hemispherical dome of force.\n\nOnce targets are loaded into the purple worm, nothingó-not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects-ócan pass through the barrier, in or out, though targets in the sphere can breathe there. The hemisphere is immune to all damage, and creatures and objects inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a target inside the hemisphere damage anything outside it. The atmosphere inside the dome is comfortable and dry regardless of conditions outside it.\n\nThe purple worm waits until you give it a mental command to depart, at which point it dives back into the ground and travels, without need for rest or food, as directly as possible while avoiding obstacles to a destination known to you. It travels 150 miles per day.\n\nWhen the purple worm reaches its destination it surfaces, the dome vanishes, and it disgorges the targets in its mouth before diving back into the depths again.\n\nThe purple worm remains charmed by you until it has delivered you to your destination and returned to the depths, or until it is attacked at which point the charm ends, it vomits its targets in the nearest unoccupied space as soon as possible, and then retreats to safety.\n\nRange: Special (150 miles)\n\nRare Versions\nCyneburg's Surfacing Wormway. When this spell ends early because the purple worm is attacked, it travels to the surface to spit the targets out and then retreats to safety.",

        "Desc": "As part of the casting of this spell, you lay down in the coffin on a patch of bare earth and it buries itself. Over the following week, you are incapacitated and do not need air, food, or sleep. Your insides are eaten by worms, but you do not die and your skin remains intact. If you are exhumed during this time, or if the spell is otherwise interrupted, you die.\n\nAt the end of the week, the transformation is complete and your true form is permanently changed. Your appearance is unchanged but underneath your skin is a sentient mass of worms. Any creature that makes a Medicine check against your spell save DC realizes that there is something moving underneath your skin. \n\nYour statistics change in the following ways:\n\nYour type changes to aberration, and you do not age or require sleep.\nYou cannot be healed by normal means, but you can spend an action or bonus action to consume 2d6 live worms, regaining an equal amount of hit points by adding them to your body.\nYou can sense and telepathically control all worms that have the beast type and are within 60 feet of you.\nIn addition, you are able to discard your shell of skin and travel as a writhing mass of worms. As an action, you can abandon your skin and pour out onto the ground. In this form you have the statistics of swarm of insects with the following exceptions: you keep your hit points, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma scores, and proficiencies. You know but cannot cast spells in this form. You also gain a burrow speed of 10 feet. Any worms touching you instantly join with your swarm, granting you a number of temporary hit points equal to the number of worms that join with your form (maximum 40 temporary hit points). These temporary hit points last until you are no longer in this form. If you spend an hour in the same space as a dead creature of your original form's size, you can eat its insides and inhabit its skin in the same way you once inhabited your own. While you are in your swarm form, the most recent skin you inhabited remains intact and you can move back into a previously inhabited skin in 1 minute.",
